Bonhoeffer was born in 1906, son of a professor of psychiatry and
neurology at the University of Berlin. He was an outstanding student, and
at the age of 25 became a lecturer in systematic theology at the same
University. When Hitler came to power in 1933, Bonhoeffer became a
leading spokesman for the Confessing Church, the center of Protestant
resistance to the Nazis. He organized and for a time led the underground
seminary of the Confessing Church. His book <i>Life Together</i>
describes the life of the Christian community in that seminary, and his
book <i>The Cost of Discipleship</i> attacks what he calls "cheap grace,"
meaning grace used as an excuse for moral laxity. Bonhoeffer had been
taught not to "resist the powers that be," but he came to believe that to
do so was sometimes the right choice. In 1939 his brother-in-law
introduced him to a group planning the overthrow of Hitler, and he made
significant contributions to their work. (He was at this time an employee
of the Military Intelligence Department.) He was arrested in April 1943
and imprisoned in Berlin. After the failure of the attempt on Hitler's
life in April 1944, he was sent first to Buchenwald and then to
Schoenberg Prison. His life was spared, because he had a relative who
stood high in the government; but then this relative was himself
implicated in anti-Nazi plots. On Sunday 8 April 1945, he had just
finished conducting a service of worship at Schoenberg, when two soldiers
came in, saying, "Prisoner Bonhoeffer, make ready and come with us," the
standard summons to a condemned prisoner. As he left, he said to another
prisoner, "This is the end -- but for me, the beginning -- of life." He
was hanged the next day, less than a week before the Allies reached the
camp.

<p>
Some of his later writings insist that many Christians do not take
seriously enough the existence and power of evil. Because of this and
other statements of his, some theological advocates of "secularist
Christianity" in the 1960's attempted to claim him as their own. In my
judgement, a study of his writings (even his later writings) as a whole
does not support this claim. However, it is true that he never had a
chance to edit his prison letters and papers, or put them into context,
and accordingly it is not surprising that they contain some statements
that baffle the reader.

<p>
The following hymn was written by him in the concentration camp, shortly
before his death.

<blockquote>
By gracious powers so wonderfully sheltered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And confidently waiting come what may,<br>
we know that God is with us night and morning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and never fails to greet us each new day.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Yet is this heart by its old foe tormented,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still evil days bring burdens hard to bear;<br>
Oh, give our frightened souls the sure salvation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for which, O Lord, You taught us to prepare.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And when this cup You give is filled to brimming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With bitter suffering, hard to understand,<br>
we take it thankfully and without trembling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;out of so good and so beloved a hand.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Yet when again in this same world You give us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy we had, the brightness of Your Sun,<br>
we shall remember all the days we lived through,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and our whole life shall then be Yours alone.<br>
</blockquote>

This hymn appears in the 1982 Episcopal Hymnal (695). The translator is
F. Pratt Green (1903- ) listed in hymnal indexes sometimes under Green
and sometimes under Pratt Green. The translation copyright is Hope
Publishing Company 1974.

<p>
The hymn appears as 637 in the current Finnish Hymnal, translated by
Anna-Maija Raittila, and beginning "Hyvyyden voiman ihmeelliseen
suojaan".

<i>Church Leaders Remember Dietrich Bonhoeffer</i>
<p>
(Eni) Fifty years after the execution of Dietrich Bonhoeffer at the age
of 39 on April 9, 1945, at the hands of one of Hitler's special commandos
in the concentration camp of Flossenbuerg, church leaders have paid
tribute to the German Lutheran theologian who joined the political
opposition to Hitler. At a recent memorial service in Flossenbuerg, Klaus
Engelhardt, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Church in Germany
(Ekd), described how Bonhoeffer refused to be placed on the prayer list
of the Confessing Church after his imprisonment in 1943. "Bonhoeffer
believed that only those who were imprisoned because of their
proclamation or actions in the service of the church belonged on the
prayer list, but not those imprisoned as political conspirators," he
said. Engelhardt asserted that the church today should think again about
how it supports those who exercise their resistance to injustice through
political means. "Is our Protestant church not in the position and not
prepared to support or pray for those who take the path of political
resistance to inhumanity or the perversion of law and order?" he asked.
"They are among those who hunger and thirst for righteousness and whom
Jesus praises in the beatitudes."

<H4>PRAYER (traditional language):</H4>
<blockquote>
Gracious God, the Beyond in the midst of our life, who gavest
Grace to thy servant Dietrich Bonhoeffer to know and teach the
truth as it is in Jesus Christ, and to bear the cost of
following him: Grant that we, strengthened by his teaching and
example, may receive thy word and embrace its call with an
undivided heart; through Jesus Christ our Savior, who liveth
and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever
and ever.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
O God our Father, who art the source of strength to all thy
Saints, and who didst bring thy servant Dietrich Bonhoeffer
through imprisonment and death to the joys of life eternal:
Grant that we, being encouraged by their examples, may hold
fast the faith that we profess, and that we may seek to know,
and acccording to our knowledge to do, thy will, even unto
death; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth
with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.
